The zip file contains all files needed for the program to run.

1) ffc_calc.m -> This file is used to run the classifier using fft. Simply run the file in matlab to print the accuracy.

2)best_feat.m -> It uses top 20 best features to classify the music. Simply run the file in matlab to print the accuracy.

3)mfcc_calc.m -> This file uses mfcc coefficients as features. Simply run the file in matlab to print the accuracy. 

4)melcepst.m is the external file needed to extract mfcc coefficients from the music files.


The folders inside the zip files are source files for music genre. So it should be in the path during any script run.

Also voice box is external tool folder needed for the calculating mfcc coefficients.

Report for project is inside Report.docx .
